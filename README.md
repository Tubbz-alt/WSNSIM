 This article modeled the data routing problem in Wireless Sensor Networks as an in-zone random process. The data packets are randomly routed from the source to the sink within the defined Routing Zone via any-path . The proposed “Zone Probabilistic Routing (ZPR)” is a distributed probabilistic and randomized anycast routing protocol. In ZPR, the forwarding probability distribution is defined by multiplying the Four Probability Distributions (4PD) namely: direction, transmission distance, perpendicular distance, and residual energy. In order to meet different performance requirements for different applications, these probability distributions are completely controllable via a set of exponential control-parameters (direction control, transmission distance control, perpendicular distance control, and residual energy control). This set of parameters is user-oriented and can be modified prior to nodes deployment to achieve different performances. Through extensive simulations and experimental results, the optimal values for these exponential control-parameters have been obtained to meet different performance requirements in terms of energy consumption, energy balancing, network lifetime, and delay. Furthermore, through an extensive performance evaluation study and simulation of large-scale scenarios, the results showed that our proposed ZPR protocol achieved better performance compared to the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and data routing efficiency.

#FRCA: A Novel Flexible Routing Computing Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks

In wireless sensor networks, routing protocols with immutable network policies lacking the flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environment situations and application requirements. The proposed "Flexible Routing Computing Approach (FRCA)" is a novel distributed and probabilistic computing approach capable of modifying or upgrading routing policies on the fly with low cost, which effectively enhances the routing flexibility. FRCA models the routing metric as a forwarding probability distribution for routing decisions. This model depends on three elements, the physical quantities collected at sensor nodes, the built-in base math functions, and the routing parameters. These elements are all user-oriented and can be specified to implement multifarious complicated network policies meeting different performance requirements. More significantly, through distributing routing parameters from the sink to end nodes, operators are allowed to adjust network policies on the fly without interrupting the network services. Through extensive performance evaluation studies and simulations, the results demonstrate that routing protocols designed based on FRCA could achieve better performance compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts regarding network lifetime, energy consumption, and duplicate packets as well as ensure high flexibility during network policies modification or upgrade.
